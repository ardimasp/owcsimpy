        ----------
        LEDs: list
            List of LEDs. But, currently supports 1 LED.
        PDs: list
            List of PDs. Currently supports 1 PD.
        blockingObj: list
            List of blocking objects. 
        reflectingObj: list
            List of reflecting objects, for example a room.
            The naming is due to we might need a genera case when
            we can do the assumptions of infinite room such that 
            what matters most are the ceiling and the floor.
            Note that the blockingObj will also be treated as a 
            relfecting object.
